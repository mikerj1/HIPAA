#Administrative Safeguards (see <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/adminsafeguards.pdf">164.308</a>)

Taken directly from the wording of the Security Rule, administrative safeguards are *administrative actions, and policies and procedures, to manage the selection, development, implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entity's workforce in relation to the protection of that information.*

There aren't specific security settings in this section, and the most important area covered is the risk assessment. The risk assessment is a fundamental process for any organization that wants to become compliant.


##Security Management Process - 164.308(a)(1)(i)

Standard | Description
--------- | -----------
Risk Analysis (Req)  | Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI held by the covered entity.
Risk Management (Req) | Implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with Sec. 164.306(a) [Security standards: General rules; (a) General requirements].
Sanction Policy (Req) | Apply appropriate sanctions against workforce members who fail to comply with the security policies and procedures of the covered entity.
Information System Activity Review (Req) | Implement procedures to regularly review records of information system activity, such as audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking reports.

Datica Health, Inc. has a risk management policy that defines the risk analysis and risk management process. This policy is operationalized with processes to conduct regularly risk assessments. Datica uses NIST800-30 and 800-26 for performing risk analysis. Our policy begins with an inventory of all Datica systems, mapping of where ePHI is processed, transmitted, or stored, identification of threats, risks, and likelihood, and the mitigation of risks. Policies address risk inherent within the environment and mitigating the risk to an acceptable and reasonable level.

Datica has a Sanction Policy that has sanctions for employees not adhering to certain policies, and for specifically violating HIPAA rules.

Policies and procedures address the requirements of monitoring and logging system level events and actions taken by individuals within the environment. All requests into and out of the Datica network are logged, as well as all system events. Datica, has implemented multiple logging and monitoring solutions to track events within their environment and to monitor for certain types of behavior. Log data is regularly reviewed. Additionally, proactive alerts are enabled and triggered based on certain suspicious activity.


##Assigned Security Responsibility - 164.308(a)(2)

Standard | Description
--------- | -----------
Assigned Security Responsibility (Req) | Identify the security official who is responsible for the development and implementation of the policies and procedures required by this subpart for the entity.

Datica Health, Inc. has policies in place that require workforce members requesting access to ePHI to submit an authorization form that is signed and acknowledges their responsibility of safeguarding ePHI. The form must also be approved by the Security Officer. Once signed and approved, then the individual will be provisioned access to systems deemed business necessary. All Access to ePHI is based on minimum necessary requirements and least privilege. Datica cannot access ePHI unless customers explicitly grant access.

Datica policies define the immediate removal of access once an employee has been terminated, with the Security Officer responsible for terminating the access. Once HR initiates the termination process the termination checklist is referenced to ensure necessary actions are taken to remove systems and facilities access.
